    Here is an example of what a training dataset for a chess CNN might look like:

    The `X_train` array contains the board states, where each board state is represented 
    as a 3D array with dimensions `(6, 8, 8)`. The first dimension represents the six 
    different types of pieces (pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king), the second and 
    third dimensions represent the position of each piece on the board 
    (with values ranging from 0 to 7).

    The `y_train` array contains the corresponding moves, where each move is represented 
    as an integer between 0 and 72. These integers correspond to the 73 possible moves 
    (including the \"null move\") that can be made from each board state.\n\nNote that the 
    data in this example is just for demonstration purposes, and the actual data used for 
    training a chess CNN would need to be much larger and more diverse in order to achieve 
    good results.

    the model using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss. Finally, we save the 
    model's parameters to a file so that it can be used for prediction in the future.
